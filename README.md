# AirQueue

AirQueue is a platform designed to enhance your music-sharing experience with friends through interactive Live Sessions. Integrating seemlessly with the Spotify Developer API to search for songs, as well as interact with the user's Spotify account.

## Getting Started

	```

3. **Docker** is used for containerization. Confirm Docker is installed by running:

	docker --version
	```

4. **Node** and **NPM** (Node Package Manager) are needed for managing frontend dependencies. Check their installations with:

	```bash
	node --version
	npm --version
	```

	```

4. Use Sail to build and start the application:

## Usage

### Live Sessions

Start or join a Live Session using a Session ID and an optional passcode to share music with others. You can view incoming song requests from other participants and search for songs to request from them.

### Bands

Bands in AirQueue make it easy to share music and start Live Sessions with friends. You can join a Band via an invitation from the owner or create your own Band and invite others to share music together.

### Song Requests

When you receive a song request, you can choose to approve or deny it. Denying a request removes it from your queue, while approving a request adds the song to your live Spotify playerâ€™s queue.
